### About me:
Let me tell you a little about myself. My name is Vlad, I was born in Belarus, but I've been living and working in Poland for a few years now. My last job was in logistics, while working there I realized that I need to change my job by all means urgently, so I decided to become a web developer :) So this CV may be called as first step in the right direction. Also I love to play soccer, make and edit some videos in instagram. But now I learn English most of my free time. As a person I am communicative, it is not difficult for me to make new contacts. Also I like to travel, which is why I want to change my profession so that in the future I could work from anywhere in the world where I would like to live.
